Landing Page Project (Udacity Nanodegree)

Project Summary

This project aims to give an opportunity to manipulate the DOM of a multi-section landing page. Often times, we donâ€™t know how much content will be added to a page through a CMS or an API. To circumvent this problem, I dynamically add the content to the page.

To improve the user experience, the section actively being viewed is differentiated with different colour. Additionally, when a user clicks on a navigation item, the item should scroll the users to the appropriate section rather than giving the default jump.
